Educational codes of data science

This is a student project for a data mining course.  
In this notebook, we tried to implement the data mining process in brief.
Five algorithms have been examined in this code, which are:
*   DecisionTree
*  RandomForest
*  LogisticRegression
*  SVM
*  NeuralNetwork

In the final step, we compared these models based on the existing model evaluation criteria
