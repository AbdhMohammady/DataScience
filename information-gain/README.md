# Information Gain

In this notebook, we are going to implement the method to calculate information gain based on entropy and Gini method. This is an educational notebook and I request the readers to report any bugs to AbdhMohammady@gmail.com or leave comment on my github https://github.com/AbdhMohammady. I tried to write this notebook so that it can be used for other datasets, currently this notebook can be used for datasets with categorical columns and two-class for target column. At the end of the notebook, after obtaining the highest information gain,you can use this column as the root of the decision tree algorithm.
